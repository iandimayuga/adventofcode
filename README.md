Solutions for Advent of Code puzzles https://adventofcode.com

## Why are you using Python?
- It's quick.
- I enjoy it.
- I don't get to use it a lot at work.
- Variable-length integers!

## Why are you doing the days out of order?
I don't usually have time to solve the puzzle the day it drops,
but out of a competitive spirit I'd like to place somewhere other than last on my friends' leaderboard.  
So, I prioritize puzzles by point value, i.e. the ones that have been solved by the least number of my friends so far.
